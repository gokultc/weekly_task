num1=int(input("Enter number 1 :")) #int is added
num2=int(input("Enter number 2 :"))
sum=(num1+num2)
print(sum)

# "hello" + "hai" ="hellohai"

# if two strings are combined or added we get the concatenation result.

# anything that is read using the input function it is considered as a string value.

# to read the value as an integer then we need to define the int before the input function.
